# Love Those Pets
Beagle Hacks Project

## Inspiration
Everyone loves dogs yet there are plenty of dogs which are abandoned. Additionally, pet dog owners are unclear about how to care for your pets and what to feed them. We wanted to solve these problems through our platform and make it easier for everyone to show their love & care to dogs

## What it does
Our project provides the following functionality
1. Adopting Pets
2. Donating money to organizations
3. Nearby stores to buy stuff for pets
4. Pet Vaccination Scheduling
5. Pet Food Care Guide

## How we built it
- Website is built using ReactJs, CSS and JavaScript.
- Backend is done using NodeJS and MongoDB as database
- Sendgrid has been used to send updates through Email about successful adoption
- GitHub management of the project using Pull Requests, different branches and commits.
- Domain.com has been used to get a custom Domain

## Usage of GitHub
- Created different branches for different features - parallel development
- Used Pull Requests to merge the branches
- Tested features before merging
- Continuous commits to keep track of the progress
